## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?


## Answers

1. I was really excited for this course.  I don't know how to describe it but I was really interested in learning python.  My expectations were to learn everything there is to know about python.

2. Sprint 5 had me stumped.  The problem I was having was inside the departure event.  I had the create a departure event directly after going past the elif into the departure.  For some reason, the program was creating too many departure events.  This would then cause the program to crash when it checked them against the arrival events.  I never figured out why it was doing that.  I fixed it by sticking the create departure event inside the if/elif statement in the departure section.  I still kinda want to know why it was creating too many departure events though.

3. I told my mom about that statisics problem you presented near the beginning of the class.  About how around 32% of people who test positive for a disease actually have the disease.  This lead to a long discussion about the amount of positive tests we have in the country for covid.  

4. Adaptability from this class.  I changed it up and went from being in person to learning remotely.  This was mainly due to me having a class 10 minutes after one of your classes that was remote only.  It was a serious problem trying to find a location on campus I could sit for 3 hours, and be able to respond (25% of my grade in film class was class interaction so kinda had to do it, so this removed a lot of areas due to not wanting to disturb people around me).

5. I really liked learning remote for this semester, but last semester was rough when the school closed.  The most challenging for me was keeping up with the group because of all our different schedules.  Being able to wake up an hour later worked well for me.

6. Like I said in my other writing, I believe in person is better.  It could just be that is the way I have always done it so it is more known to me.  With the way the world seems to be going it might be changing.  I really can't think of any positive aspects of online teaching to incorporate.  Every idea I have I can almost immediately think of a con to it.

7. As I said before I didn't really learn anything new about myself.  Maybe if I was 20 years younger this would have been a huge change to me.  But I am more of a go with the flow kinda guy.
