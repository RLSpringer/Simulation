As the graphs show, using a high priority queue decreases the average residence time for
everyone in the system.  The numbers were slightly surprising.  

Where λ = .50, 55% people having fast passes was slightly better than 60% by about 
.000x degree.  So very slightly.

Where λ = .95, 60% people having fast passes was slightly better than 65% by about the same
degree.  

So if a system was lazy, they could just put the high priorty queue as 60% without
too much variation on residence times.  

Especially if the system was known to have periods of low utilization and high 
utilization at different times.
